# Evaluate News NLP

This project uses MeaningCloud API for Natural Language Processing (NLP), using the technologies of Webpack, Sass styles, Webpack Loaders and Plugins, Service Workers, and API.

## Project Description

The project is aimed at allowing users to submit URLs of articles or blog posts. The application then analyzes the content of the submitted URLs using the MeaningCloud API to determine various attributes such as polarity, subjectivity, and text content. The analysis results are then displayed to the user.
